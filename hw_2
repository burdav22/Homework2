## Homework 2

# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done. When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.


###
### Problem 1
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

from hw2_test import* #imports variable n from hw2_test

c = 1
t = 0
while n > 0: # while n is greater than 0 it enters the loop
    total = total + count #adds the previous sum to the running count
    count = count+1 # running count
    n = n-1
print total
    
###
### Problem 2
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 2 solution follows:"


for i in range(1, 10): # loop numbers from 1-10
    i = i/1.0 #is there a better way to turn i into a floating point? I can't figure one out.
    print 1/i

###
### Problem 3
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in range (n+1):
    triangular = triangular+i
print "Triangular number", n, "via loop:", triangular
print "Triangular number", n, "via formula:", n*(n+1)/2

###
### Problem 4
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

n=10
multi=1
for i in range(n):
    multi= multi*(i+1) #makes multi equal the previous multi times the running count
if n == 0: # if the factorial is 0! print multi-1 or else just print multi
    print multi-1
else:
    print multi
    

###
### Problem 5
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

n=10
facto=1
for i in range(n):
    facto=1 #resets facto after it has gone through second for loop
    x= n
    x = n-i #reduces the range of x by 1 each time
    for j in range(x):
         facto= facto*(j+1) #creates the factorial
    print facto

###
### Problem 6
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"
facto=1
add=1
for i in range(n):
    add = add+(1/facto) #adds the previous factorial to the new one
    facto=1
    x= n
    x = n-i
    for j in range(x):
         facto= facto*(j+1)/1.0
print add
